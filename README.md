This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

Getting Started
First, clone this repository and install modules:

npm i pnpm i

then run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

Deploy on Vercel
OR the easiest way to see the result of my task is to go to deployed vercel app: https://asteroid-task-l24480fog-jika1995.vercel.app/  :) Enjoy!
